# Introduction

OTLY is an extensible framework for collaborative real-time document edition. At its core there is an Operational Transformation (OT) engine that takes care of synchronizing the documents being edited by different clients.

OTLY provides a set of APIs for creating and interacting with real-time documents. It also provides a set of SPIs for allowing developers to extend the framework by providing new document models and bindings.
